/**
 * Visual sideways offset for bikelane lines.
 *
 * Background: bikelane geometries are derived from the road centerline. Historically the
 * processing shifted them sideways in the database (PostGIS `ST_OffsetCurve`, see the
 * removed `2_move_bikelanes.sql`) so the two sides of a street rendered as separate lines.
 * That made the stored geometry harder to analyse. We now keep the geometry on the
 * centerline and reproduce the sideways shift purely visually, here.
 *
 * Two zoom regimes, split at {@link interactivityConfiguration.bikelanes.minzoom} (the
 * interactivity cutoff). Below that zoom, tiles only carry `stylingKeys` — not `offset` —
 * plus the always-present `id` column (`way/…/left`, `way/…/right`, or `way/…` for
 * center-running `self`). Above it, full tags including `offset` are present.
 *
 * - **Below minzoom:** nudge each side by half the layer's stroke width so the two sides
 *   sit flush against the centerline (no overlap, no road-width gap). Side comes from `id`.
 *   A meter-based gap would be sub-pixel at these zooms anyway.
 * - **At/above minzoom:** convert the absolute `offset` attribute (meters; the sign is
 *   `+` left / `-` right of the OSM way, computed in processing as half the road width)
 *   to screen pixels so the two sides sit at the road edge.
 *
 * Meter → pixel conversion: MapLibre `line-offset` is in screen pixels, while `offset` is
 * in ground meters. Web Mercator ground resolution halves every zoom level, so
 * pixels-per-meter scales as `2^zoom`. MapLibre reproduces that exactly with an
 * `['exponential', 2]` interpolation between two zoom stops (base-2 interpolation IS the
 * `2^zoom` curve, so the value is exact between the stops and clamped outside them).
 *
 * Caveats:
 * - The meter→pixel factor depends on latitude (`cos φ`). We bake in a reference latitude
 *   (~52.5°, center of Germany). Away from it the on-screen offset is off by roughly ±9%
 *   across Germany — sub-pixel where the offset is small, acceptable when zoomed in.
 * - Only `line` layers can be offset this way. Symbol/text layers placed along the line
 *   (`symbol-placement: 'line-center'`, e.g. width/surface/traffic-sign labels) cannot be
 *   perpendicular-offset via the style and stay on the centerline.
 * - `['zoom']` may only be the input of a top-level `interpolate`/`step`, so the compact
 *   low-zoom nudge cannot nest the layer's own zoom-driven `line-width`. We take half of
 *   the clamped low-zoom width (first interpolate/step output) instead.
