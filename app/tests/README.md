# Playwright E2E Tests

## Setup

1. Install browsers: `bunx playwright install chromium` (Playwright is already a project dependency)
2. Configure: Create `app/.env.test` with `TEST_OSM_USERNAME` and `TEST_OSM_PASSWORD`
3. Configure app: Set `VITE_PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED=true` in repo root `.env` (see `.env.example`). Vitest unit tests use the repo root `.env`; `app/.env.test` is Playwright-only.
4. For smoke tests only: `bun run e2e` will start the dev server via `webServer` if not already running (requires db+tiles — see [`docs/docker-local-development.md`](../../docs/docker-local-development.md)). For full suite: start app with `bun run dev` (predev starts Docker), then run tests.

## Usage

```bash
bun run e2e                    # Run all tests (chromium; starts dev server if needed)
bun run e2e -- tests/smoke     # Run only smoke tests (one per public route)
bun run e2e -- --ui            # UI mode
bun run e2e -- --debug         # Debug mode
```

## Smoke tests (autonomous)

`tests/smoke/public-routes.spec.ts` runs one unauthenticated smoke test per public route: page loads, no crash, no unexpected redirect, `main` visible, no console errors. Use for migration/regression (e.g. after Next → TanStack Start) or CI.

## Authentication

Run `auth-setup.spec.ts` first to create session. Other tests (admin, regions as logged-in) reuse stored session.

## Map Testing

Set `VITE_PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED=true` to enable Playwright testing mode. This enables test IDs, `window.__mainMap` (MapLibre instance for layer-order and style inspection), and the `mapLoaded` event.

Helpers in [`tests/utils/maps.ts`](utils/maps.ts):

- `waitForMapLoad` — waits for `mapLoaded` or canvas
- `getMapLayerIds` — reads `window.__mainMap.getStyle().layers` (requires prior `waitForMapLoad`)
- `verifyMapRendered`, `checkMapTilesLoaded`

App wiring: `exposeMainMapForDebugging` / `firePlaywrightMapLoadedEvent` in `src/components/shared/utils/playwright.ts` (called from `RegionMap` `onLoad`).

## LLM Usage

Tests can be run autonomously to verify app quality:

- All pages render without errors
- Maps display correctly
- Network requests succeed
- No console errors

Use `bun run e2e` to evaluate app state. Tests are self-contained and can be run in CI/CD.
