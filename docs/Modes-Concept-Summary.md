# Region modes

A region has a shared map and extra pages that reconfigure the UI around it. The default map stays `/regionen/<region>`. Hinweise, Qualitätssicherung, Prüflisten, and Summieren are their own routes. They show up in the main navigation when the region has the matching data (notes flags, at least one QA config, review lists, a category with a dataset to sum). Members can open Prüflisten before the first list exists so they can create one.

Who may open and change what per mode: [Permissions.md](./Permissions.md).

URL keys and filters: [Modes-URL-State-Contract-And-Optimizations.md](./Modes-URL-State-Contract-And-Optimizations.md). Selection `f`: [Features-Parameter-Deeplinks.md](./Features-Parameter-Deeplinks.md).

| Mode               | URL                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Map (default)      | `/regionen/<region>`             |
| Hinweise           | `/regionen/<region>/hinweise`    |
| Qualitätssicherung | `/regionen/<region>/qa`          |
| Prüflisten         | `/regionen/<region>/prueflisten` |
| Summieren          | `/regionen/<region>/summieren`   |

Switching modes keeps map position and layer configuration. Each mode stores its filters in one JSON search object (`notes`, `qa`, `review`, `sum`) and restores them when you come back.

## Shared panel

The right `ModePanel` has a heading, a collection selector (QA config, Prüfliste, or — for internal Hinweise — Ordner; read-only only for OSM Hinweise), a filter bar (search, chips or status, current map view vs all), and a list of compact previews. On desktop the panel sits on the map edge and is resizable.

The inspector still shows the selected feature. Hovering a list row draws a mode-accent ring on the map (clamped to the viewport when the geometry is off-screen). Clicking the map or a row writes `f`, scrolls the row into view, and opens details. Hover does not select.

| Feature                     | Default map                                                                            | Dedicated mode                                           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hinweise                    | Inspector "new note" tools navigate into the mode. No note markers on the default map. | Yes. OSM and/or TILDA folders; one collection at a time. |
| Qualitätssicherung          | No                                                                                     | Yes only                                                 |
| Prüflisten                  | No                                                                                     | Yes only                                                 |
| Summieren (area calculator) | No. The former "Summieren: …" layers are gone from the category UI.                    | Yes only                                                 |

## Hinweise

Lists the region's notes. OSM and TILDA internal notes are independent region flags. When both are off, Hinweise is hidden from the primary menu. When one is on, the collection dropdown shows only that source. When both are on, OSM appears as one (public) row in the same dropdown as the TILDA folders; `notes.key` is `'osm'` or a folder id, and the list/map never mix the two. Search, extent, and chips live in `notes`. Pins render only in this mode. From the default-map inspector, "new note" still jumps here (`notes.new` compose pin).

OSM notes are public. Internal notes are member-only. The Hinweise route is member-only when the region has only internal notes (OSM also on keeps the page open for guests, who only see OSM).

Internal notes are grouped into **Ordner** (`NoteFolder`), the same collection pattern as Prüflisten: many-to-many with regions (a folder can be shared across several region views of the same customer, e.g. one customer with several region cut-outs), one URL `key` selects the active folder, and the panel header has the create / rename / delete menu. A note lives in exactly one folder; the folder's regions are the note's regions — there is no separate `Note.regionId`. Every region that had internal notes enabled when the folders migration ran starts with one folder named "Allgemein"; regions created after that start empty and must create a first folder before "Neuer Hinweis" is available. Deleting a folder is blocked while it has notes, and a shared folder can only be unlinked in `/admin/note-folders`. Moving a note to another folder happens in the note detail view; the URL follows the note to its new folder. The map layer, list, and download always scope to the active folder only.

Admin: `/admin/note-folders` assigns folders to regions, mirroring `/admin/review-lists`.

## Qualitätssicherung

`/qa` is the only place QA layers and the area list exist. Pick a config, filter by status / users / search / extent, work the list. Details stay in the inspector.

Bookmarks that still carried the old in-map QA query params are steered here.

### Status

Each area has a **system** status from nightly comparison of reference vs current counts, and optionally a **user** status from a person.

System: `GOOD` (green), `NEEDS_REVIEW` (yellow), `PROBLEMATIC` (red), `TRUSTED_EDITOR_CHANGE` (blue, »Gut (Vertrauensliste)«). No evaluation paints gray.

User (overrides the system color when set):

- `OK_STRUCTURAL_CHANGE` — OK, construction or structural change
- `OK_REFERENCE_ERROR` — OK, wrong reference data
- `OK_QA_TOOLING_ERROR` — OK, QA geometry or definition error (teal in the UI)
- `NOT_OK_DATA_ERROR` — not OK, current data needs a fix
- `NOT_OK_PROCESSING_ERROR` — not OK, processing needs a fix

Absolute difference is checked before percent. If `|absoluteDifference|` is at most `QaConfig.absoluteDifferenceThreshold`, the effective system status is `GOOD` even when the percent looks worse.

### What nightly processing does

First run on an area always writes a system evaluation. After that it writes a new row only when the effective system status changed, or when a user decision must be cleared.

- Structural-change and reference-error OK stay forever.
- Tooling-error OK and both NOT_OK values stay until the effective system status becomes `GOOD`. Then the user fields are cleared (`userStatus`, `body`, `userId` null).
- Users never set system status. `NEEDS_REVIEW` is system-only.

Nightly rules, including the trusted-editor check: [QA-Documentation.md](./QA-Documentation.md). Code: [`qaEvaluationRules.ts`](../app/src/server/qa-configs/evaluation/qaEvaluationRules.ts) (`getQaUpdateDecision`). Map coloring and cache: [QA-Map-Status-Payload.md](./QA-Map-Status-Payload.md). Parking freeze baseline: [Parking-Client-Freeze-QA.md](./Parking-Client-Freeze-QA.md).

New configs are created in admin. The source table needs a string `id`, comparison counts, and polygon geometry. Set `mapTable` to that table.

## Summieren

The area calculator. Draw one or more areas on the map; the panel sums the values of the selected dataset inside them (e.g. parking spaces, area) and breaks them down by property. Tools are shown icon-only in the header switcher until they are active.

- **Datasets** are a list owned by the mode ([`calculatorDatasets.const.ts`](../app/src/components/regionen/pageRegionSlug/modes/calculator/calculatorDatasets.const.ts)), not categories. Today they are the four parking layers of the sidebar (public / private, street / off-street), with the same names and ids, for regions with the category `parkingTilda`. The points of the selected dataset are only on the map in this mode; those that are part of the sum are shown in full color, the others faded.
- **Filter:** a click on a value of the breakdown narrows the sum to points with that value (several tags combine); the other points are dimmed on the map.
- **Darstellung:** the points can be colored by one of the properties of the breakdown; the values in the panel then carry the color and are the legend.
- **Nothing is stored.** Dataset, filter, coloring and areas live in the URL in one param (`sum`), so a calculation is shared by its link. The areas stay in the URL when switching to another mode and are back when returning.
- **Open to everyone** who can see the region.
- The sum is computed in the browser from the points rendered on the map, so the whole area has to be in view (the panel warns otherwise).
- While the mode is open, map clicks belong to drawing: the inspector does not open.

Old links keep working: `draw` becomes `sum.areas`, and a "Summieren: …" layer switched on in `config` opens this mode with that dataset ([`migrateLegacyCalculatorSubcategories.server.ts`](../app/src/server/regions/migrateLegacyCalculatorSubcategories.server.ts)).

## Prüflisten

GeoJSON lists of candidates (points, lines, polygons, including Multi\*). Pick a list, set status, comment. Lists live in the database, can be assigned to several regions, and support upload/download. Members can draw new entries and edit geometry. Source is upload or manual.

UI names: **Prüfliste** / **Prüfeintrag**. Status and comments exist. A richer evaluation workflow is still placeholder-level. Admin: `/admin/review-lists`.
