# Permissions

Who can see and do what in TILDA Geo. This is the central reference for humans and agents. When you change an access check, update the matching row here and the test named in it.

Two things are easy to mix up:

- **Access** (this document) is enforced on the server: server functions, API routes, and route loaders.
- **Display** (navigation buttons, lock icons, disabled menu items) only mirrors access. Hiding a button is never the protection, because every server function can be called directly.

## Roles

| Role   | How you get it                                             | Scope                                                                     |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Guest  | Not signed in                                              | Public pages, PUBLIC regions                                              |
| User   | Signed in with OpenStreetMap                               | Same as guest, plus own profile and OSM notes under their own OSM account |
| Member | A `Membership` row for that region (set in `/admin/users`) | Member-only features of that region                                       |
| Admin  | `User.role = ADMIN` in the database                        | Everything. Counts as a member of every region                            |

Sign-in is OpenStreetMap OAuth only; email/password is disabled (`app/src/server/auth/auth.server.ts`). Membership is the only per-region permission. There are no per-feature or per-category roles.

Core helpers in `app/src/server/authorization/`:

| Helper                                                                | Answers                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `checkRegionAuthorization`                                            | May this session open the region at all? (region status, see below)                   |
| `getRegionHasPermissions`                                             | Is this session a member or admin of the region?                                      |
| `canAccessMemberModeForRegion`                                        | Both: region is open to them **and** they are member/admin. Use for member-only reads |
| `authorizeRegionMemberByRegionSlug` / `authorizeRegionMemberByNoteId` | Throws unless member/admin. Use for member writes                                     |

**Rule of thumb:** region status decides whether the region opens. It never grants access to member-only data. A member-only read on a PUBLIC region must use `canAccessMemberModeForRegion`, not `checkRegionAuthorization`.

## Region status

| Status        | Who can open the region                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PUBLIC`      | Everyone who knows the URL                             |
| `PRIVATE`     | Members and admins                                     |
| `DEACTIVATED` | Admins only. Others see "Diese Region ist deaktiviert" |

`promoted` is separate from status and does not change access. The public `/regionen` overview lists only promoted PUBLIC regions.

When a region is denied, the page data is redacted before it reaches the client (`redactRegionForDeniedAccess.server.ts`): map, mask, bbox, categories, background sources, exports, contract, welcome, and logo are removed. Only slug, name, status, and product stay for the denied screen.

Tests: `redactRegionForDeniedAccess.server.test.ts`, `app/tests/pages/region-welcome.spec.ts`, `app/tests/pages/docs-region-downloads.spec.ts`. `checkRegionAuthorization.server.test.ts` (status × viewer table).

## Public pages

| Page                                         | Access                          | Notes                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/` (marketing)                              | Public                          | Indexed                                                                                                                           |
| `/kontakt` (incl. Impressum), `/datenschutz` | Public                          | `noindex`                                                                                                                         |
| `/docs/$tableName`                           | Public                          | `noindex`. Optional `?r=<region>` adds region context only when the region is open to the viewer; downloads there need membership |
| `/access-denied`, `/oAuthError`              | Public                          | `noindex`                                                                                                                         |
| `/settings/user`                             | Signed-in users (404 otherwise) | `noindex`. Edits only the user's own profile                                                                                      |

Non-production builds are `noindex` globally (`app/src/routes/__root.tsx`).

Tests: `app/tests/smoke/public-routes.spec.ts` (renders only, does not check `noindex`).

## Admin area

- `/admin/*` requires `role = ADMIN` (`app/src/routes/admin.tsx` → `getIsAdminFn`). Signed-in non-admins go to `/access-denied`, guests to sign-in.
- Every server function used by the admin UI calls `requireAdmin`, either in the `*.functions.ts` handler or in the `queries/` / `mutations/` file it calls.
- Configuration is admin-only: regions, memberships, QA configs, map dataset uploads and categories, region contracts, data schema, API tokens, and the region links of Prüflisten.

Tests: `app/tests/pages/admin.stubbed-auth.spec.ts` (non-admin and guest are turned away). Individual `requireAdmin` call sites have no unit tests.

## HTTP API (`app/src/routes/api`)

| Location                                                  | Guard                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `api/admin/*`                                             | `guardAdminApi`: Bearer `AdminApiToken` (minted by an admin). A few routes use the admin session instead                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `/mcp`                                                    | `guardAdminApi` (Bearer `AdminApiToken`). Hinweise and Prüflisten tools then run the member functions as the token owner                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `api/private/*`                                           | `ATLAS_API_KEY` (system hooks)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `api/auth/osm-token`, `api/notes/$regionSlug/$folderId/*` | `ExternalApiToken` (Bearer, 1 hour, scope `notes`), issued by `api/auth/osm-token` for a verified OSM access token. Then the same member/admin checks as the UI. CORS allow-list `externalApiOrigins`. See [External-Notes-API.md](External-Notes-API.md)                                |
| `api/*` (top level)                                       | Mixed, per route: none for public data (boundaries, map style, stats, campaigns, OSM notes RSS), member/admin for region data (`uploads.$slug`, `notes.$regionSlug.download`, `regions.$regionSlug.uploads-csv`, `export.*`), `ATLAS_API_KEY` for `regions`, `uploads`, `uploads.create` |

Three kinds of keys:

- **`AdminApiToken`**: per admin, revocable, admin-equivalent for `api/admin/*` and `/mcp`.
- **`ATLAS_API_KEY`**: one shared secret passed as `?apiKey=`. On `export.*` and `notes.$regionSlug.download` it replaces the member/admin check (including for DEACTIVATED regions). Treat it as admin-equivalent for those routes.

- **`ExternalApiToken`**: per user, short-lived, only for the external notes API. It carries who the user is, not what they may do: role and region membership are read on every request, so it never gives more access than the user's own login. Only an OSM user who already has a TILDA account gets one (no account is created by the exchange). Not accepted by `requireAuth`, server functions, `api/admin/*` or `/mcp`.

`checkApiKey` accepts every request when `NODE_ENV=development`. Never set that on a reachable deployment.

Tests: `checkApiKey.server.test.ts` (`ATLAS_API_KEY`, incl. the development skip), `guardAdminApi.server.test.ts` (`/mcp` and `api/admin/*` tokens: missing, unknown, revoked, demoted owner), `authGuards.server.test.ts` (`guardRegionMembership`). `osmToken.server.test.ts` (token exchange: OSM rejects the token, no TILDA account, only the hash stored) and `externalNotes.server.test.ts` (expired / unknown / wrong-scope token, wrong origin and preflight). Export membership: `app/tests/pages/docs-region-downloads.spec.ts`.

## Region data

| Data                      | Read                                                                                                                                                  | Change                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Categories (map layers)   | Follows region access. No per-category access                                                                                                         | Admin (region config) |
| Calculator ("Summieren")  | Its own mode, see below. Offered when the region has a category with a dataset to sum                                                                 | n/a                   |
| Static datasets / uploads | `public` flag per upload. Non-public files need member/admin, checked on the file route (`api/uploads.$slug.ts`). Non-public entries show a lock icon | Admin                 |
| Exports                   | Region config decides **which** tables. Downloading **always** needs member/admin (or `ATLAS_API_KEY`), also on PUBLIC regions                        | Admin (region config) |

Tests: `docs-region-downloads.spec.ts` (export: guest denied on PUBLIC, admin allowed), `regionModalAccess.test.ts` (which tables are offered). Non-public upload files: `app/tests/pages/uploads-access.stubbed-auth.spec.ts` (guest 401, non-member 403, member passes).

## Region modes

The mode routes (`app/src/routes/regionen/$regionSlug/*.tsx`) first require region access (parent layout), then redirect non-members of member-only modes to `/access-denied`. Navigation buttons follow `deriveAvailableModes` and `isMemberOnlyMode` in `availableModes.ts`. The server functions below enforce the same rules on their own.

| Mode                        | Opens for                                                                      | Shown in navigation when                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Map (default)               | Everyone with region access                                                    | Always                                                                                |
| Hinweise (`/hinweise`)      | Region access. Member-only when the region has internal notes and no OSM notes | Region has OSM or internal notes enabled. Otherwise the route redirects to the map    |
| Qualitätssicherung (`/qa`)  | Members and admins                                                             | Member/admin and at least one QA config                                               |
| Prüflisten (`/prueflisten`) | Members and admins                                                             | Member/admin (also before the first list exists)                                      |
| Summieren (`/summieren`)    | Everyone with region access. Nothing is stored; areas and dataset are URL only | Region has a category with a dataset to sum. Otherwise the route redirects to the map |

Tests: `availableModes.test.ts`, `app/tests/smoke/region-modes.spec.ts` (guests denied; Summieren open to guests), `app/tests/pages/modes-access.stubbed-auth.spec.ts` (signed-in non-member denied, plain member allowed), `canAccessMemberModeForRegion.server.test.ts`.

### Hinweise: OSM notes

- **Read:** fetched in the browser from the public OSM API. Visible wherever the Hinweise page opens.
- **Create:** any signed-in user, posted to openstreetmap.org under their own OSM account (`createOsmNote.server.ts`). Not tied to a region or membership, because the note lands in public OSM data anyway. The compose UI only exists where OSM notes can be read (Hinweise mode, and the inspector link when the region has OSM notes), so this is an accepted gap.
- **Member badge** on an OSM username: only if that OSM account has a `Membership` for this region. A TILDA login without membership is not enough. The list of region members (OSM name + TILDA names) is member/admin-only (`getRegionMemberOsmNames`). Guests never see the badge.

### Hinweise: internal notes

Internal notes are always member-only, including on PUBLIC regions.

| Action                                     | Who                                                                                                                    | Code                                                                                   |

| Delete folder                              | Member, admin: only empty folders linked to this region only. Admin (`/admin/note-folders`): empty folders, no cascade | `deleteNoteFolder`, `deleteNoteFolderForAdmin`                                         |
| Move note to another folder                | Member, admin                                                                                                          | `moveNoteToFolder`                                                                     |
| Change which regions a folder is linked to | Admin only                                                                                                             | `updateNoteFolderForAdmin`                                                             |

Folders (`NoteFolder`) are assigned to regions in `/admin/note-folders` (admin-only). OSM as a virtual folder in the Hinweise dropdown is not a `NoteFolder` row. Member writes bind the note/comment/folder to the acting region (`assertNoteInRegion` / `assertFolderInRegion`, or the same constraint in the lookup `where`).

The same list / read / create / comment / resolve actions are available to external clients (the iD editor fork) under `api/notes/$regionSlug/$folderId`. They call the functions above with a session built from an `ExternalApiToken` instead of the cookie (`memberCaller.server.ts`), so the member checks are the same. Writes are audited with the user and `changeSource: EXTERNAL_API`. Edit, delete and folder actions are not offered there.

The admin MCP (`/mcp`, tools `note_folders_*`, `notes_*`, `note_comments_*`) offers every action of the table; `note_folders_update` is the admin update (rename and region links). It calls the same functions with the owner of the `AdminApiToken` as session (`adminApiMemberCaller`), so the rules above hold: the owner is an admin and passes the member check in every region, but edits and deletes only own notes and comments, and deletes only empty folders linked to one region. A rejected call answers "Not allowed: …" and names the rule. Writes are audited with the owner and `changeSource: API`.

Tests: `getNotesAndCommentsForRegion.server.test.ts` (non-member gets nothing). `externalNotes.server.test.ts` (external API: member vs non-member incl. PUBLIC region, folder not linked to the region, note of another folder). `notesAuthorOnly.server.test.ts` (edit/delete of notes and comments: author only, another member and admin rejected; lookups scoped to the acting region). `notesMutationsRegion.server.test.ts` (resolve/comment reject notes outside the acting region). `deleteNoteFolder.server.test.ts` (non-empty and shared folders blocked). `moveNoteToFolder.server.test.ts` (target folder must belong to the region). `buildMcpServer.integration.test.ts` (MCP: round-trip, audit attribution, edit/delete of another author rejected).

### Qualitätssicherung

Everything is member/admin-only: navigation, map styles (status colors), area list, evaluations, and comments. Status colors are loaded through an authorized server function, never through public tiles ([QA-Map-Status-Payload.md](./QA-Map-Status-Payload.md)).

| Action                                                  | Who                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read configs, area list, map status, evaluations, users | Member, admin (`canAccessMemberModeForRegion`; the config must belong to the region)                                          |
| Create evaluation (status + comment)                    | Member, admin (`createQaEvaluation`). Author edits the comment (`updateQaEvaluationBody`); status and delete are not editable |
| Create / edit / delete QA config                        | Admin                                                                                                                         |

Tests: `app/tests/pages/qa-mode.stubbed-auth.spec.ts` (admin happy path), mode tests above. `qaConfigAdminOnly.server.test.ts` (config create/update/delete reject non-admins).

### Prüflisten

Everything is member/admin-only. A list can be linked to several regions; the acting region must be one of them.

| Action                                                | Who                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read lists, entries, GeoJSON download                 | Member, admin                                                                                                 |
| Create list (linked to the acting region)             | Member, admin                                                                                                 |
| Rename list                                           | Member, admin                                                                                                 |
| Delete list                                           | Member, admin: only empty lists linked to this region only. Admin (`/admin/review-lists`): any list, cascades |
| Change which regions a list is linked to              | Admin only (`updateReviewListForAdmin`)                                                                       |
| Create, edit, delete entries; upload GeoJSON; comment | Member, admin. Author edits own comment (`updateReviewEntryComment`); no delete                               |

The admin MCP (`/mcp`, tools `review_lists_*`, `review_entries_*`, `review_entry_comments_*`) offers the member actions of the table except the GeoJSON upload and download. As for Hinweise it calls the same functions with the owner of the `AdminApiToken` as session, so it deletes only empty lists linked to one region. `review_lists_update` is the admin update (rename and region links).

Tests: `reviewListMutationsAuth.server.test.ts` (every member mutation rejects non-members before DB access; rename cannot change region links; shared lists cannot be deleted by members), `getReviewEntry.server.test.ts`, `app/tests/pages/review-lists-mode.stubbed-auth.spec.ts`.

## Comments

Comments share the access of the object they belong to. Only the author edits a comment (and must still be a member); admins get no bypass. Edits are written with `runWithAuditContextAsync` (audit log with user, IP, `MEMBER_FORM`), and the UI shows "aktualisiert" with `updatedAt`.

| Feature        | Edit own comment                             | Delete own comment | Admin edits others |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Internal notes | Yes (`updateNoteComment`)                    | Yes                | No                 |
| QA evaluations | Yes, comment only (`updateQaEvaluationBody`) | No                 | No                 |
| Prüfeinträge   | Yes (`updateReviewEntryComment`)             | No                 | No                 |

Tests: `updateQaEvaluationBody.server.test.ts`, `updateReviewEntryComment.server.test.ts`, `notesAuthorOnly.server.test.ts`.

## Known gaps and open decisions

- **Author vs. admin:** product memory was "author or admin may edit". The code is author-only everywhere. Decide before adding an admin bypass.
- **Exports:** members-only is not a per-region setting; it is always on.
- **Not tested on purpose:** each individual `requireAdmin` call site in admin server functions (covered by the `/admin` route guard test and code review).
