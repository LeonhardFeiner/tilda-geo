-- WHAT IT DOES:
-- Merge spatially connected parkings with same tags into single parkings.
-- * Cluster parkings by tags using ST_ClusterDBSCAN
-- * Merge clustered parkings: sum capacity/area, merge geometries (ST_LineMerge)
--   (Two merging strategies are used.)
-- * Handle failed merges: remove capacity tags (will be estimated in `5_estimate_parking_capacities.sql`)
--   (…and Log warnings if needed.)
-- INPUT: `_parking_parkings_cutted` (linestring) - parkings after cutouts
-- OUTPUT: `_parking_parkings_merged` (linestring, 5243), `_parking_parkings_failed_merges` (failed cases)

-- Fallback merge step: more aggressive geometry union when the initial merge left multiple rows per id.
-- When: Only clusters where the initial merge (ST_Collect + ST_Node + ST_LineMerge) produced more than one row for the same id (HAVING count(*) > 1). That happens when geometries are not perfectly connected—e.g. kerb lines from adjacent ways overlap after offset; ST_Node splits them at intersection points and ST_LineMerge cannot reconnect the fragments into one line.
-- Why ST_Union: ST_Union(geom) merges (dissolves) geometries that touch or overlap, whereas ST_LineMerge requires exact endpoint connections. Using ST_Union first allows merging segments with small gaps or overlaps that the initial method could not merge.
-- Fallback geometry chain (per cluster):
-- 1. Save all rows with that id to a temp table; DELETE those rows from _parking_parkings_merged.
-- 2. For each cluster: ST_Union(geom) over all saved geoms for that id → ST_Node(...) → ST_Dump(...) to get one geometry per segment.
-- 3. Filter: keep only segments with ST_Length > 0.5 (drop tiny overlap fragments).
-- 4. ST_Collect(noded geoms) → ST_LineMerge → ST_Dump; (path, geom) gives one result segment per row.
-- 5. INSERT every (path, geom) as a separate row with the same id. We do not use UPDATE + dedup—that would non-deterministically keep only one row and drop the rest, losing geometry. Preserving all segments here lets the failed_merges step below assign unique ids (id || path[1]) when the cluster still has multiple disconnected segments.
-- 6. Clean up overlap artifacts: ST_Node can create short stubs (~2m) at crossing points of offset kerbs. These survive the > 0.5m filter but are much shorter than the real parking segments. We remove segments that are both < 5m AND < 20% of the cluster's longest segment.
