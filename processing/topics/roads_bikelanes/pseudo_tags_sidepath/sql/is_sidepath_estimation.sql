-- is_sidepath estimation (CSV output only).
-- Adapted from https://github.com/lu-fennell/OSM-Sidepath-Estimation
--
-- Prerequisites: tables (created by the entry script) must expose geometry in SRID 3857 (meters):
--   _sidepath_estimation_paths(path_nr bigint, osm_id bigint, geom geometry, layer text, is_crossing boolean)
--   _sidepath_estimation_roads(osm_id bigint, geom geometry, road text, name text, layer text, maxspeed text)
-- The entry script casts source geoms to geometry in SRID 3857, so buffer_distance and buffer_size are in meters.
-- If geoms were 4326, ST_Length would be in degrees and ST_DWithin(..., 22) would be 22 degrees (wrong).
--
-- Provided: table _sidepath_estimation_result
--   (osm_id bigint, is_sidepath_estimation text, adjoining_road text, adjoining_maxspeed text)
--
-- Default parameters (override with -v when invoking the entry script):
--   buffer_distance  Distance between checkpoints along a path, in meters (default 190.0).
--   buffer_size      Radius of each checkpoint for ST_DWithin to roads, in meters (default 22.0).
--
-- Voting (per path osm_id):
--   checks  = number of checkpoints of the path.
--   votes   = number of checkpoints that see a given road id / road class / road name (NULL name = '')
--             within buffer_size on the same layer (both layers NULL or equal).
--   is_sidepath when any road id, class or name passes `tilda_sidepath_is_sidepath_by_checks`.
--   adjoining_road = road class with most votes (ties: `tilda_sidepath_highway_rank`);
--   adjoining_maxspeed = highest numeric maxspeed of that class among the hits.
--
-- Written as plain set-based CREATE TABLE AS steps (no sequences, no custom aggregates) so Postgres
-- can use parallel workers for the checkpoint and spatial join steps.
