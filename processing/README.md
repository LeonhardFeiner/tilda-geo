# `processing` README

## Monorepo

Please read the [README](../README.md) first.

## About

The processing downloads the OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, filters and processes it into a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, which is then made available as vector tiles with [`martin`](https://github.com/maplibre/martin).

The data is selected and optimized to make planning of bicycle infrastructure easier.

## Orchestration

We use Bun and [Bun Shell](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/shell) to orchestrate the commands needed to fetch, filter, process and post-process the data and trigger post-processing hooks.
See [`index.ts`](./index.ts) for more.

## Freshness

### Freshness of source data

The data is updated daily based on OSM extracts provided by [Geofabrik for Germany](https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany.html).
It includes OSM changes up until ~20:00 h of teh previous day.
The processing should be finished at about 6:00 h of the current day (+/- 2 h).
Which data is used in the app is visible in the download modal (Download-Icon on the bottom right of the map).

### Freshness of processed data

- Data is processed every day ([cron job definition](/.github/workflows/generate-tiles.yml#L3-L6))
- Data is processed on every deploy/release

## Preview

### Martin catalogue and preview

See https://github.com/FixMyBerlin/tilda-geo/blob/develop/processing/utils/logging.ts#L31-L40 for a list URLs to see the data that Martin provides.

## Development

### Preparation

- [Install bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
- Run `bun install` in `./processing`

### Run the whole system

The workflow is…

1. Edit the files locally

2. Rebuild and restart everything

   Frist, make sure you are in the root folder of this repo.

   ```sh
   docker compose build && docker compose up
   ```

3. Inspect the new results, see "Inspect changes"

> **Note**
> Our [development docker compose](../docker-compose.override.yml) add two `volumens` which means in most cases, we don't need to run `docker compose build`. For multiple local checkouts and isolated stacks, see [`docs/docker-local-development.md`](../docs/docker-local-development.md).

> **Note**
> Learn more about the file/folder-structure and coding patterns in [`processing/topics/README.md`](/processing/topics/README.md)

### Processing: Run changes only

With `SKIP_UNCHANGED=1` we compare the hashes of all `.lua` and `.sql` files to the last run per topic.
During [`run-5-process.sh`](processing/run-5-process.sh) we only run code if the respective hash has changed.
If any helper in (`topics/helper`)[processing/topics/helper] or the OSM file has changed, we rerun everything.

After `Processing: Finished`, the **afterthoughts** phase runs deferred work (see `processing/steps/afterthoughts.ts`):

1. **Statistics** — populates `public.aggregated_lengths` (empty table created at initialize; afterthoughts fill rows; feeds `/api/stats` and region statistics UI).
2. **Sidepath export** — writes `is_sidepath_estimation.csv` for the next run's `roads_bikelanes` Lua import (or afterthoughts when topic schedule moved sidepath post-topics). Skipped when `roads_bikelanes` did not run only if a CSV already exists; otherwise exports from the current DB. When the topic ran but the OSM file and `pseudo_tags_sidepath/` are unchanged, an existing CSV is reused.

Settlement-area export is not run (#3423).

Whenever we talk about `hash`es in this code, this feature is referenced.

### Processing: Inspect changes

With `PROCESSING_DIFFING_MODE=previous`, `PROCESSING_DIFFING_MODE=fixed`, or `PROCESSING_DIFFING_MODE=reference` the system will create `public.<tablename>_diff` tables that contain only changed entries (except `reference` mode which creates a clean baseline).

It will compare the `tags` column to the previous run.

Whenever we talk about `diff`s in this code, this feature is referenced.

The `PROCESSING_DIFFING_BBOX` bbox (required when diffing is on) specifies which area is used for the diff. This allows to reduce the data size of the diff.

#### Reference

- With `PROCESSING_DIFFING_MODE=previous` you see the changes to the last run on every run
  - Diffing is skipped only when a new source PBF file is downloaded
- With `PROCESSING_DIFFING_MODE=fixed` you see the changes to the last reference-run, allowing you to compare your changes to a certain version of your data.
  The reference will be the last time you ran with `PROCESSING_DIFFING_MODE=previous` or `PROCESSING_DIFFING_MODE=reference`.
  With `fixed` the system will **not** update the `diffing_reference.<tablename>` tables.
  - Diffing is skipped only when a new source PBF file is downloaded
- With `PROCESSING_DIFFING_MODE=reference` you create a clean baseline reference for subsequent comparisons.
  This mode always creates/updates reference tables (ignoring file change status) and removes all diff tables for a clean slate.
  Use this before starting test iterations, then run with `fixed` mode for consistent comparisons against the same reference.

#### Deployment Configuration

The diffing mode is configured differently depending on the deployment context:

- **Staging nightly runs** (scheduled daily): `PROCESSING_DIFFING_MODE=reference` - Creates/updates the baseline reference
- **Production nightly runs** (scheduled daily): `PROCESSING_DIFFING_MODE=off` - No diffing
- **Staging deploys**: `PROCESSING_DIFFING_MODE=fixed` - Compares against the frozen, previous day's reference without updating it
- **Production deploys**: `PROCESSING_DIFFING_MODE=off` - No diffing

To run everything without code caching and diffing set `SKIP_UNCHANGED=0` and `PROCESSING_DIFFING_MODE=off`.

**Diffing timing in logs:** Timed diffing steps use the same style as topic timing: `Diffing: <step> - Start` then `Diffing: <step> – Took HH:MM:SS` (same `formatTimestamp` as "X finished in HH:MM:SS"). Steps: "Create reference tables", "Create reference tables (reference mode)", "Update diffs (previous|fixed)". Grep for `Diffing:` to see all diffing log lines.

### Process only certain topics and certain bbox

Per-run vars (`PROCESS_ONLY_TOPICS`, `PROCESS_ONLY_BBOX`, `OSM2PGSQL_*`, `WAIT_FOR_FRESH_DATA`, `SKIP_WARM_CACHE`) are for **local dev** only — set them via `bun run processing` (inline env on the printed one-liner). Server baseline config comes from the deploy manifest ([`.github/env/deploy.manifest.json`](../.github/env/deploy.manifest.json)) which generates `/srv/.env`; per-run overrides are passed inline on the `docker compose up` command (see the CI workflows), not edited into `/srv/.env` by hand.

`OSM2PGSQL_NUMBER_PROCESSES` defaults to **4** on staging and production (benchmarked 2026-06-26). See [`docs/osm2pgsql-number-processes.md`](docs/osm2pgsql-number-processes.md).

Per-topic osmium tag-filter profiles were tried and reverted (2026-06-28) — see [`docs/per-topic-osmium-tag-filter.md`](docs/per-topic-osmium-tag-filter.md) before changing filter architecture.

- Use `PROCESS_ONLY_TOPICS=parking` to only run the "parking" topic.
  Format: "topic1,topic2".
  This can be used during development to speed up the process.

- Use `PROCESS_ONLY_BBOX=13.4178,52.4681,13.4550,52.4817` to only process data withing this bbox.
  Format: MINLON,MINLAT,MAXLON,MAXLAT.
  This can be used during development to speed up the process.
  Best to use this with `PROCESS_ONLY_TOPICS` because it will create a filtered source for each topic.

## Tests

We use the luarocks package [busted](https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/) as our testing framework.

To run the tests manually:

```
./processing/run-tests.sh // from the root of the project
```

Additionally all tests are being run in the [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) [pre-push](../app/.husky/pre-push) hook.

**Conventions:**

- Create one test file per helper
- Filename has to be `\*.test.lua`
- Place it in a `__tests__` folder next to the file

**Good to know:**

- To use the `Log` helper (`require("Log")`) to inspect and print data ([Docs](https://github.com/kikito/inspect.lua?tab=readme-ov-file#installation))

## Geofabrik OAuth

Geofabrik provides two datasets. We use the internal download when possible and fall back to the public data.
The internal download includes the osm username but more importantly it is ready a few hours before the public download is.

More: https://osm-internal.download.geofabrik.de/

To use OAuth-protected downloads from Geofabrik, configure the `PROCESS_GEOFABRIK_*` environment variables and update the download URL, see [.env.example](../.env.example).

The OAuth implementation uses [Geofabrik's official `oauth_cookie_client.py`](https://github.com/geofabrik/sendfile_osm_oauth_protector) which handles Cookie authentication automatically during processing.

Our high level setup is:

1. [processing.Dockerfile](/processing.Dockerfile) downloads the newest verion of the `oauth_cookie_client.py`
2. On each processing-run ([processing/index.ts](/processing/index.ts))
   1. We first [`initializeOAuth`](/processing/steps/initializeOAuth.ts) which gives us a **valid cookie** by running the python script or **falls back to the public URL**.
   2. We [download](/processing/steps/download.ts) the either the public or internal pdf file.

## Deployment

1. First https://github.com/FixMyBerlin/tilda-geo/actions runs.
2. Server (IONOS) runs the processing one table at a time.
   The whole processing takes about 1.5 h.
   See [`index.ts`](./index.ts) for details.
